Show demo

good news
---------
Basis of everything works
with this setup i can now start communication with iServer
resources and links should match with iServer
everything is done with only JS and HTML5
one-one links
one many links (rest should be trivial)
	only visualisation of authoring can take some time

bad news
--------
web security gets in the way (show with firefox or default chrome)
some websites will simply not serve if they detect that they are loaded in a frame
	explain alternative with loading DOM in sandboxed divs
highly responsive websites will fail
	explain hashing of ranges/common ancestor
currently using 3th party libs
	range selection
	serializations
	wrapping
		issue is that it only works with textnodes, not with images etc.
		recently got the non compressed version by the author, so i can edit this now if i have some time

first point of business
-----------------------
preparing presentation

currently working on
--------------------
updating authoring of manymany links
	probbably going to use some overlay forms with drag and drop to make it fancy
connecting to iServer and storing data there.

whats up next
-------------
rewrite some of the rangy library to have better wrapping and hashing only common ancestors
find out exactly what is serialised for a range.
start researching on visualisation of many links on a page
