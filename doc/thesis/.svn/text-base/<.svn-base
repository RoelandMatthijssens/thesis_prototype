\paragraph{}
With over \num{150000} new websites being produced every day, the World Wide Web is playing an increasingly more important role in day to day life. From personal use to big internet companies, the Web is omnipresent in a modern society. The Web was created in the late 1980s and has been publicly available since 1991 but after all this time, very little has changed to the core ideas. The idea of the Web was seeded by Vannevar Bush's vision of the Memex but has evolved hastily to match the needs of the consumers. This haphazard evolution of the web gave priority to new flashy features neglecting the foundation of the Web: Linking different resources together. Modern websites are still mostly using anchor tags, a technique designed in 1994, to link their web pages together.
\paragraph{}
In this thesis, we take a critical stance toward conventional linking techniques and the popular tools that have become a standard for browsing the Web. From an evolutionary point of view it is clear why the current standard includes out-dated techniques and this evolution indicated that even though anchor tags are the single most used technique to link resources together, it does not imply that this is the most optimal or complete approach.
\paragraph{}
Through literature study and critical thinking we identify a number of important flaws and shortcomings regarding the core concepts of standard linking techniques. A closer look at alternative approaches showed that more advanced and complete techniques are already available. By studying these alternatives and taking a step back from the dogma of standard linking techniques we were able to apply state of the art research from the fields of information management and visualisation, effectively increasing the Web's potential and ameliorating the majority of its current limitations. Our proposed solution provides a new angle on the way resources can be linked on the Web and bases itself on recent research in the areas of hypermedia and data visualisation.

----------
Our MindXpres presentation solution is a fresh look on presentation tools and
bases itself on recent research in the areas of hypermedia, spatial hypertext
and zoomable user interfaces. By using an information base of semantically
linked data, our tool is able to store and process information in a more hu-
man accessible way. Instead of having to spread complex ideas over disjunct
A
slides, information can be stored in its original form. A L TEX-like language
for presentation authoring brings the focus back to the content, reducing the
time required to create a presentation and increasing the overall quality of
the presented information. MindXpres automatically visualises content via
themes and an extensible plug-in system. This visualisation layer combines
a zoomable user interface with psychological concepts that enforce spatial
reasoning, which keeps the original idea intact and easier to process by the
audience. The extensible MindXpres core allows users to add new content
types or change the way information is handled. Furtermore, the use of the
latest HTML5 standards for the visualisation ensures the maximum porta-
bility of presentations.
While it is perfectly possible to create classic slide-based presentations with
MindXpres, our solution offers features that go beyond state of the art slide-
ware tools. MindXpres provides the means for breaking free from the linear-
ity and the restrictive nature of existing slideware. The choice of technology
allows new ways of input and a degree of interactivity that is previously
unheard of. On top of that, the plug-in architecture provides the possibility
to present content types not supported by existing tools. As a first step in a
new direction, we provide a solid presentation framework that will form the
center of focus for future research. Through our innovative MindXpres solu-
tion, we are going to enhance the presentation experience for the presenter
and audience alike in the near future!

%We are currently living in an information age, where an estimated \num{150000} new websites are created on a daily basis. Since the HTML 2.0 standard was introduced in 1995, content creators are able to add anchor tags to their websites. These tags allow web pages to be interlinked, forming a vast interlinked web of information. To navigate this Web, we use browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or Oracle's Opera.
%
%\paragraph{} 
%HTML standards have gone through several iterations since HTML 2.0. We are currently at HTML5 and a lot of features have been changed and added. However, the way web pages are linked together has remained unchanged. The main mechanism web developers use to create links between web pages is still the same anchor tag that was introduced almost 20 years ago. This anchor tag is not without limitations though. The only type of links that can be established using anchor tags are unidirectional single source and single destination links between two resources.
%
%\paragraph{} 
% One possible definition for the Web could be the following \todo{find exact source}: \dquote{\emph{A system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet}}. The core of this definition is that these pages need to be interlinked, therefore it is rather strange that the technology that is used to create these links has not been updated or improved over the last decades.
%
%\paragraph{} 
%HTML and HTTP were invented in 1990 by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee. The term hypertext was already coined in 1963 by Ted Nelson, predating the HTML standard by a couple of decades. Nelson defines hypertext as \dquote{\emph{Non-sequential writing}} meaning that the text can branch in different directions. At a certain point in a block of text, a pointer may be introduced that directs the reader to a different section, or even a different document. Ted Nelson's idea of hypertext was heavily influenced by Vannevar Bush and his idea of the Memex. With his hypertext, Nelson aims to mimic the associative links between content as introduced by Bush. Ted Nelson's hypertext idea may sound reminiscent of the current HTML's anchor tags, where one source can embed a link to another source. But in fact Ted Nelson stated that his vision of hypertext actually tried to prevent the evolution that is currently active in HTML standards. HTML only supports unidirectional links, and as a result quotes cannot be followed back to their original source. There is also no notion of version or rights management and existing links keep breaking when the content of websites is updated. Nelson stated, because of these limitations, that the current HTML standard is a major oversimplification of his original idea of hypertext and hypermedia.

%These obvious problems with linking in HTML were the cause of several initiatives are attempting to \dquote{fix the web} and get closer to the initial ideas of hypertext and hypermedia.
%Most of these initiatives originate from other research labs that aim to enhance the Web. The main difference between existing tools and our tool is the setting in which it will be used. Existing tools were designed and developed as a private tool to be used by a single person for his own personal interests. At best, these tools could be used by a small group of users that share the same interests and needs. The tool we will present in this thesis is designed and developed as a tool for a whole community or even a large set of different communities with different interests and needs. However, in designing this tool, we encountered an important problem. This problem was masked in existing tools because they were intended to be used by a single person which, in most cases, greatly limits the amount of data the tool would have to operate on. When we increased the amount of users that will use the tool simultaneously we encountered some interesting issues.
%
%\paragraph{} 
%Imagine users annotating a web page with comments and adding a couple of links between two web pages they have previously visited. This user will highlight a couple of sentences or words on these pages to mark the location of the annotation and the sources of the links. But because this user is the only person using the system they can choose not to create too many links on a specific paragraph, or they can have a specific way of annotating pages that will suit their work style. In other words, the user can easily control the amount of metadata that is put on a specific page. If a page gets too cluttered for the users' taste, they could remove or rewrite some of the annotations until the web page is to his liking once more. In a multi-user setting this issue becomes a lot more prominent. Imagine a popular news website that gets thousands of daily hits. A good percentage of these users will read an article about something they have read before. These users might want to share their information with the rest of the community by adding an annotation to the article or by adding a link to another website that has more information on the topic. Since there might be thousands of users reading this specific article, it is possible that too many users try to share their information, thus quickly cluttering the text. If we naively add all this extra data to the web page the page will become unreadable and the tool will hinder the users instead of helping them find more information. For most of the existing tools, the usability of the tool is therefore inversely proportional to the amount of users that will share their data with each other.
%
%\paragraph{} 
%The main problem when a multitude of users are sharing the same database is actually a visualisation problem. The usability issues, that other tools have, originate from their naive way of visualising the metadata on the web page. The question that arises is the following: \dquote{How can we visualise the metadata that is generated by a large community of users, without reducing the usability of the web page?} 
%
%\paragraph{} 
%In this thesis we explore previous attempts to increase the Web's linking functionality and investigate areas where improvements can be made. In Chapter \ref{cha:Limitations of Linking Techniques}, we discuss the current techniques that are used to link resources. We will describe why these techniques are suboptimal and why there is a need for improved linking functionality. In Chapter \ref{cha:Towards a Better Web}, we will take a look at alternative approaches to the default HTML linking. These alternative tools will give us additional insights in how we could improve upon the default linking functionality.
%
%\paragraph{} 
%Based on our conclusions from Chapter \ref{cha:Towards a Better Web} and some personal insights, we define key the concepts that our tool needs to provide in Chapter \ref{cha:An Alternative Approach}. By generalising our problem to a data visualisation problem instead of limiting us to the canvas of a web page, we can apply recent work in the active field of data visualisation. These insights will help us to mitigate some of the problems the alternative approaches introduced. In Chapter \ref{cha:The Tool}, we propose a different solution based on our findings in Chapter \ref{cha:An Alternative Approach}. This solution is then implemented and discussed in Chapter \ref{cha:Implementation}. In order to demonstrate the benefits that our solution claims to provide, we follow up the implementation with some use cases that will show how the tool operates in a real world setting. This is done in Chapter \ref{cha:Use Cases} where we walk through the entire process of authoring and navigating through annotations and links, discussing our improvements along the way.

%\paragraph{} 
%As this is a Master's thesis, time was limited and our work is restricted by the available time. However, in Chapter \ref{cha:Conclusions and Future Work} we will discuss the final conclusion, as well as the possible future work that can be done to further extend the tool.
%
%\paragraph{} 
%By extending the Web's current linking technology and by allowing communities to use a single database to share their metadata, we aim to provide a better web experience for both content creators and consumers. We are confident that our proposed tool improves many of the issues we have identified and greatly improves the accessibility of metadata for large groups of users.
