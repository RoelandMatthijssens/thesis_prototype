\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\paragraph{}
First of all, I would like to thank my promoter and advisor, Prof.~Dr.~Beat Signer for giving me the opportunity to research this topic and for his invaluable support. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the endless patience and countless hours you spend proof-reading every detail of this document.
\paragraph{}
My special thanks goes out to Rik Vanmechelen, Reinout Roels and Ruben Tytgat, whom I count as dear friends. I honestly feel I would not have made it this far without their constant support and rubber ducking when I needed it most.

\paragraph{}
I would like to thank Riot, Valve and Firaxis for helping me keep my sanity during the more difficult periods of the project.

\paragraph{}
Most importantly, I would like to thank my girlfriend, Vanessa Gerrits for bearing with me through countless nights of working late. Her endless patience while reading and rereading all the drafts of this thesis were invaluable, as was her constant loving support.
