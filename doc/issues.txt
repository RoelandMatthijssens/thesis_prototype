same origin policy
	cannot run scripts on third party websites. which would not allow me to get selections/locations of frames etc
	however the page can be run without browser security to bypass this problem
	in the case the javascript is used as a plugin in the general browser we can set our own policy for these scripts

Dynamic pages based on get/post data will load different content
	this means that the selection we linked/want to hilight is not actually on the website
	posible solution could be to include the get data into the key when storing the selection

local HTML5 databases only support an asynchronous API
	because this is asynchronous we'll have to give callback methods to the functions,
	this will posibly cause delay between launching the query and receiving the result.
	either we let the callback method set some global accessible variable to match the result
		but this can cause issues with synchronisation
	or we have a bottleneck on where the function calls happen.
		this means that the lookup for the database will receive the callback that will actually render the data on the page
		which will possibly give some delays.
